# Attention Head Composition Documentation.

## Introduction
The concept of Attention Head Composition is a pivotal aspect of understanding the inner workings of transformer models. Originating from the Transformer Circuits Thread, this framework sheds light on the intricate operations within transformers, with a special focus on the composition of attention heads.

Attention heads are fundamental components of transformer models, responsible for capturing dependencies and relationships within the input data. The composition of these heads, or the process of combining multiple attention heads to form more complex structures, significantly enhances the model's ability to process and understand data. This technique is particularly prevalent in deep transformer models, where the layering of attention heads introduces a level of expressivity and computational power that is not achievable with single, isolated heads.

Induction heads, which are a product of attention head composition, play a crucial role in enabling transformers to perform in-context learning algorithms. These algorithms allow the model to generalize from the input data, making inferences and predictions that extend beyond the immediate context. The composition of attention heads can occur in three distinct manners, each corresponding to a different component of the attention mechanism: keys, queries, and values. This tripartite composition framework allows for a versatile and dynamic approach to modeling complex data relationships.
