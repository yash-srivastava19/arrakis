## How to contribute to Arrakis?

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/yash-srivastava19/arrakis/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/yash-srivastava19/arrakis/issues/new/choose). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch, I'll mostly check and get back to you in some time.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Arrakis will generally not be accepted. Same goes for the docs as well.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes, so keep that in mind. No other 

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Arrakis, shoot me an [email](mailto:ysrivastava82@gmail.com) or DM on [Twitter](https://x.com/Yaaaaaashhh).
